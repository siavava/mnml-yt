## What Worked Well

- The Youtube API is surprisingly easy to work with.
- React is also quite interesting.

## What Didn't

> None :rocket:

## Extra Credit

I attempted to implement the `debounce` function, although my API timed out before I could fully test it.

> Update: I fixed it! It works now.  
> Implementation is in [`src/modules/debounce.ts`](./src/modules/debounce.ts)
