# CS52 SA2: Vite My Mouse!

[deployed url](https://video-search-pkvn.onrender.com/)

## What Worked Well

- The Youtube API is surprisingly easy to work with, or maybe it's because @timofei told us everything we needed to do...
- React is also quite interesting.

## What Didn't

GitHub wouldn't let me push my commits upstream, and when I force-pushed it closed the feedback PR. I couldn't figure out how to reopen it, see the comment on the PR.

## Extra Credit

I attempted to implement the `debounce` function, although my API timed out before I could fully test it.

## Screenshots

API timed out, I'll update with an image when it's back up.
